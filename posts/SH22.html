            <h1>Summer Holidays 2022 - Sweden</h1>
            <p>Welcome to this "Blog" about my summer holidays in Sweden.<BR>
            I am a 15 year old boy from Switzerland and like going in North
            Countries with my family. This is the first time I am bloging such
            a journey, but hope you enjoy reading
            </p>


            <h3>16.7.22 - Going North</h3>
            <p>Today, we dve about 600 km from the region of
                <i>Frankfurt</i> to the beautiful island <i>Fehmarn</i>.
                We depated at around 12:30 pm after enjoying the time
                with collegues of us. After departure we first
                went to a petrol station and made us ready for
                what would end up beeing a 6 hour trip to the north
                <BR>
                After we started the motor, I continued with reading a
                bool called <i>Die Anomalie</i> the book is really interesting
                and has some very interesting ideas. Therefore I would 
                definitely recommend you the read if you have time for it.
                <BR>
                After I was done with reading I decided to get my 
                mathematics stuff out and started to learn some more
                number theory in preparation for the next year swiss
                math Olympiad. In particular I looked at bounding as this
                is the big topic I havent yet paracticed for the second round
                next year.
                <BR>
                After I was done studying, I started to listen to some music.
                The time quickly went by and we soon were at the <i>Fehrmarnsundbridge</i>.
                From there it was only 10 minutes to the camping place where we resided. On
                the evening we quickly went to the beach and then soon went sleeping.
