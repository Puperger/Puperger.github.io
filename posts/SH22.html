            <h3>16.7.22 - Going North</h3>
            <p>Today, we dve about 600 km from the region of
                <i>Frankfurt</i> to the beautiful island <i>Fehmarn</i>.
                We depated at around 12:30 pm after enjoying the time
                with collegues of us. After departure we first
                went to a petrol station and made us ready for
                what would end up beeing a 6 hour trip to the north
                <BR>
                After we started the motor, I continued with reading a
                bool called <i>Die Anomalie</i> the book is really interesting
                and has some very interesting ideas. Therefore I would 
                definitely recommend you the read if you have time for it.
                <BR>
                After I was done with reading I decided to get my 
                mathematics stuff out and started to learn some more
                number theory in preparation for the next year swiss
                math Olympiad. In particular I looked at bounding as this
