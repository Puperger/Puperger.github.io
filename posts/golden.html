    <h1>Golden Object</h1>
    <p>Hello Everyone, today I want to talk with you about what I call "Golden Objects". What makes them so golden is that they
        are closely related to the golden Ratio Φ which is a mathematical constant with a lot of interesting properties. I will
        talk about what the golden ratio is and show and explain you some of the "Golden Objects".
    </p>
    <h3>The Golden Ratio</h3>
    Imagine having a line of a fixed lenght. Your task is now, to divide it into two parts of length a and b. Now that is not too interesting
    but now let us add a special condition which says: The ratio between the two lengths is equal to the ratio of the entire line to the 
    longer side or more formally: a:b = a+b:a. This has some really interesting properties,
     but before digging into them and uncovering the mythic golden objects, let us first calculate this ratio.<BR>
    The first step is to set the equation a:b=a+b:a=Φ up. The Phi here is thus equal to the ratio between the two. But if we now set b=1,
    the first and third terms say us a=Φ. So therefore lets see what we can get for a if we substitute b=1 in the first 2 terms. a=(a+1):a.
    This can now be mulitplied by a, although we need to make sure a is absolutely never 0. This is can  be seen pretty intuitively, so feel
    free to show this yourself. Now we have the equation a<sup>2</sup>=a+1.<BR>
    This can now get solved by applying the quadratic formula and we get the result (1±√(5))/2.<BR>
    Now that we have an actual idea what this value is, it might seem counterintuitive, but there are two solutions to our original problem.
    The reason for that is quite simple, as the ratio can be written as a:b or b:a thus creating the 2 diffrent results which are about 1.618
    and 0.618
