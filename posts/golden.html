    <h1>Golden Objects</h1>
    <p>Hello Everyone, today I want to talk with you about what I call "Golden Objects". What makes them so golden is that they
        are closely related to the golden Ratio \(\small \Phi\) which is a mathematical constant with a lot of interesting properties. I will
        talk about what the golden ratio is and show and explain you some of the "Golden Objects".
    </p>
    <h3>The Golden Ratio</h3>
    Imagine having a line of a fixed lenght. Your task is now, to divide it into two parts of length a and b. Now that is not too interesting
    but now let us add a special condition which says: The ratio between the two lengths is equal to the ratio of the entire line to the 
    longer side or more formally: \(\small a:b = a+b:a, a>b\). This has some really interesting properties,
    but before digging into them and uncovering the mythic golden objects, let us first calculate this ratio.<BR>
    The first step is to set the equation \(\small a:b=a+b:a=\Phi\) up. The Phi here is thus equal to the ratio between the two. 
    But if we now set b=1, the first and third terms say us a=Î¦. So therefore lets see what we can get for a if we substitute \(\small b=1\)
    in the first 2 terms. \(\small a=(a+1):a\). This can now be mulitplied by a, although we need to make sure a is absolutely never 0. 
    This is can be seen pretty intuitively, so feel free to show this yourself. Now we have the equation \(\small a^2=a+1\).<BR>
    This can now get solved by applying the quadratic formula and we get the result \(\small\Phi=\frac{1\pm\sqrt{5}}{2}\).<BR>
    Now that we have an actual idea what this value is, it might seem counterintuitive, but there are two solutions to our original problem.
    The reason for that is quite simple, as the ratio can be written as a:b or b:a thus creating the 2 diffrent results which are about 1.618
    and 0.618
    <h3>The Golden Rectangle</h3>
    Now let us move on to the first golden  Object which is the Golden Rectangle. Consider creating a line with any length. Now do the
    Harmonic division (Construct the golden ratio) on it and fold one side 90 Degrees. Now you can complete the rectangle and have made
    yourself a golden rectangle.<BR>
    But What is so special about this? Well it gets interesting, as soon as we cut of a square with side length b from any of the sides away.
    Surprisingly, the remaining figure will still be a golden rectangle and if you ask me, this is a really cool fact about this special rectangle.<BR>
    However, there is even more to it. In fact if you continue to subdivide the newly created rectangle into a square and another golden rectangle,
    you get an outer approximation for the fibonacci sequence. This is actually really nice as this helps us to see that if the nth fibonnaci
    number is \(f(n)\) then we have \(\Phi=\lim \limits_{x \to \infty} \frac{f(x)}{f(x-1)}\).<BR>
    Now we can continue on and create the fancy fibonacci spiral I'm sure many of you have seen. But since we did that in golden Rectangles,
    we now also get The Golden Spiral.<BR>
