        <h1>Website!</h1>
        <p>As you might have realised by reading this, we now have a <a href="yay.html">fantastic</a> (ie. <a href="ach.html">terrible</a>) website!
           Special thanks to Fynn Krebser for hosting and contributing to this website, and to Felix Xu for sending me the whole ASCII written in the style of the ASMR logo.</p>

        <h1>The Amazing Swiss Mathematical Revenge</h1>
        <p>After 2 months of careful preparations, looking for awful problems, designing exam timers and printing pictures of Raphi, it finally happened.
           The Amazing Swiss Mathematical Revenge took place at the Swiss MO's Aarburg training camp, on February 3rd.
           Leaders of the SMO had 14293 seconds to solve 4 amazing problems, worth 10.5 points each.
           Well as you can see on the table below we slightly overestimated their maths skills...
           Anyway, congrats to Ivan Pouly for winning this year's ASMR (by trigbashing the geo problem that we thougt was trivial) as well as an overly large amount of ginger!
           Congrats too to Patrick Stalder, who won a framed picture of Raphi that immediately got purchased by Tanish Patil.
           And Marco Cavaleri tried too, contrarily to Tanish.
        </p>
