        <h1>Participating at the European Physics Olympiad 2024</h1>
        I have just arrived back home from my first participation at the European Physics Olympiad (EuPhO) 2024.
        The competition took place in Kutaisi, Georgia, and lasted for 5 days. The competition was very challenging,
        but I got to meet a lot of awesome people and had a lot of fun.
        <h2>All because of a technical error</h2>
        When I started last august with the Swiss Physics Olympiad, I never thought that I would make it to the EuPhO.
        In fact, when I first received my score from the First Round, I was one point short of qualifying for the Second Round.
        However, there was some mistake in the grading, and because of that I had exactly the right score to qualify.
        I'm quite sure the cutoff score would have been higher if the grading had been correct in the first place and
        I would not even have made it to the Second Round. Afterwards, in both the Second and Final Round, I was one
        of the best students and was selected to represent Switzerland at the EuPhO. (Theoretically I would have qualified
        for the International Physics Olympiad, however as it took place in Iran this year, the Swiss team decided not to
        participate.)
        <h2>My experience at the EuPhO</h2>
        The competition itself was very challenging. Especially the experimental part was difficult for me, mostly because
        I was missing one key idea to solve the problem. The theoretical part was also very challenging, but I think I did
        quite well for my knowledge level. The problems were interesting in my opinion, except the second one, which was
        about spaceships moving at relativistic speeds. I think the problem was too random and did not encourage creativity.
        The other problems were very nice and I enjoyed trying to solve them. In the end, I was super happy to win a bronze
        medal.
        <h2>The people</h2>
        Of course, the competition was super cool, but by far the best thing was meeting other people from diffrent
        countries. I met a lot of awesome people and managed to trade diffrent currencies with them. I also got to know
        many people who will go on to study physics at the university I will go to next year.
        <h2>The food</h2>
        By far the coolest thing about Georgia has to be the food. It is super delicious and I loved it. 10/10 would
        recommend.
